A secured loan requires collateral for approval. An auto loan is a form of secured loan. The lender will use your vehicle as collateral to secure your loan. If you stop making payments, the lender will repossess your car.

Home loans and auto loans are secured loans that require the money to be used for a specific purpose, i.e., buying a house or a car. A pawnshop loan is a secured personal loan — the money you receive can be used for any purpose. Both require collateral that puts the risk in the borrower’s hands.

An unsecured loan doesn’t require collateral for approval. All this loan calls for is your signature on a legally binding contract in which you promise you’ll repay the debt.

Lenders typically shy away from offering unsecured loans to consumers who have very bad credit because they come with a lot of risk to the lender. If the borrower fails to repay the debt, the lender’s only recourse is to sell the debt for pennies on the dollar to a collection agency. This means that the lender will potentially lose substantial money on the deal.

But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to find unsecured loans for bad credit. The online lending networks listed above all partner with bad credit lenders that specialize in subprime loans and will consider all loan applications with no minimum credit score requirement.
